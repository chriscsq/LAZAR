# TODO
## Crucial
Things we're definitely aiming to complete before submission:
* Create the final level layout.
* Might have to do some extended tracking fixes.

## Optional
The following are things to either do in the future, or before submission if there's time/incentive:
 * Fix bug where enemy health bars sometimes appear even when card isn't being tracked.
 * Fix the UI for different resolutions/orientations.
 * Visual effect for laser hitting enemies and/or other objects.
 * Fancier enemy vanishing effect.
 * Custom mirror model.
 * Custom turret model.
 * Game Logic:
    * Option to go to reset game upon win/loss.
